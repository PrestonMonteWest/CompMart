# CompMart
An example e-commerce website that I've been slowly building upon. This is my biggest personal project at the time of writing.

## Installing
You'll need the below python packages to have a working instance of this project. A virtual environment is recommended.

Dependencies:
* argon2 0.1.10
* argon2-cffi 18.1.0
* cryptography 1.7.1
* Django 2.0.3
* Pillow 5.1.0
* Development:
  * sqlite3
* Production:
  * psycopg2 2.6.2
* requests 2.18.4

Later versions may be and often are backwards compatible with older versions, but I make no guarantee of this. If something isn't working, consider installing the above versions explicitly.

To install:
```
pip install [list of required python packages]
```
If you don't have pip installed, follow these instructions: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/
